# Applications of this problem
Maximum subarray algorithms are used for data analysis in many fields, such as genomic sequence analysis, computer vision, and data mining.

# Importance of Kadane's Algorithm
The brute force solution has a time complexity of O(N<sup>3</sup>) while Kadane's algorithm reduces the time complexity to O(N). 
Jay Kadane also has served as the professor of statistics at Carnegie Mellon University (my Alma Mater)
