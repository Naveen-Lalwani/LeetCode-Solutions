# Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Example:

### Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
### Output: 6
### Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

# Applications of this problem
Maximum subarray algorithms are used for data analysis in many fields, such as genomic sequence analysis, computer vision, and data mining.

# Importance of Kadane's Algorithm
The brute force solution has a time complexity of O(N<sup>3</sup>) while Kadane's algorithm reduces the time complexity to O(N). 



Fun Fact: Jay Kadane also has served as the professor of statistics at Carnegie Mellon University (my Alma Mater :)).
